# Documentation for a OceanParcels setup with POP model velocities for determining the origin of Atlantic AAIW
### Content 
- `advection_routines`: folder that allows for advection and basic analysis of particles in a repeated year framework
  - `advection_execution.py`: file includes the main advection routine `full_execution`, which allows for advection for a given time, `merge_zarr` allows for re-chunking and concatenation of output over multiple iterations.
  - `displacement.py`: file includes an optional setup for a displacement of particles that get stuck along the boundaries due to the Arakawa B-grid configuration of the POP model. The displacement kernel is a 3d interpretation of the displacement routine found in the [OceanParcels Documentation](https://docs.oceanparcels.org/en/latest/examples/documentation_stuck_particles.html) 
  - `parcels_routines.py`: file includes the core parts of the advection routine, following the OceaParcels syntax of fieldset, particle set and kernels. Further, it includes a start set for particles based on density (`find_density`), and a routine to remove stuck particles from advection (`delete_stuck_particles`).
  - `post_process.py`: file includes two classes that allow for creation and plotting of metadata from a dataset produced by `advection_routines.merge_zarr`. `PlotableClass` allows for plotting of ventilation position and transit time distributions, `AnalyseTrajectory` produces metadata, such as start and ventilation position for each trajectory, that are easier to handle than the whole dataset.
